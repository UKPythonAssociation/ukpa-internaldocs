Google
======

We have a Google Workspace.
Some administrative notes:

Google Drive
------------

* We have a single shared Google Drive called "UKPATL" for tradco-associated documentation - letter templates, tracking spreadsheets, etc.

    * This Drive should be the home for conference-related docs etc.
    * At some point we will make more and delineate better - this is an "MVP"-esque setup
    * There is a Google Group called "UKPATL Directors and Conference Organisers" that has "Content Manager" permissions to the drive (i.e. can Do Things with the content).

        * The "UKPA Trustees" group is a member of this group
        * Other membership needs to be manually managed
