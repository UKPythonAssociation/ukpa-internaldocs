Support events
==============

1. The trustees of the UKPA need to satisfy themselves that the event meets the
   UKPA charitable objects and is financially viable.
2. The trustees request that UKPATL stage the event on their behalf.

UKPA versus UKPATL
------------------

- The UKPA is responsible for meeting its charitable objects.
- UKPATL takes the licence for running the event on behalf of the UKPA and is
  responsible for operational decisions and other trading matters.
