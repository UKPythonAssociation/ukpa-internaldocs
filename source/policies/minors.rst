Minors Policy
=============

Anyone under 18 attending an event supported by the UKPA must be accompanied by
an identifiable adult. This adult has responsibility for the minor at all times.
This adult must be in attendance at the event whenever the minor is and must be
contactable by the event organisers at all times.
