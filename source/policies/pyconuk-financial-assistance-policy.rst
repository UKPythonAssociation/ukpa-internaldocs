PyCon UK Financial Assistance Policy
====================================

The goal of the Financial Assistance programme is to improve the quality of
PyCon UK by:

1. Increasing the diversity of the attendees.
2. Enabling people to attend who would not otherwise be able to (particularly
   those for who PyCon UK is their most viable PyCon).
3. Enabling the spread of ideas and experiences across national boundaries.

The conference director will be responsible for appointing a committee of at
least 3 people (the director can be one of these people).

The committee will judge the applications according to the stated goals and
recommend to the board of trustees the funding allocation for each
application.
