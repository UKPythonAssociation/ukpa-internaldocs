Trustee Election Ballot Policy
==============================

Section 13.1 of our constitution requires that one-third of the elected trustees
retire at each Annual General Meeting and that the members have the opportunity to
fill the resulting vacancies (and others that may exist).

In the event that there are the same number of candidates (or fewer) than vacancies
available, then the election of those candidates shall be via `acclamation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclamation>`_

If there are more candidates than vacancies, then an election via ballot will be carried
out using `sequential proportional approval voting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_proportional_approval_voting>`_

Election via Acclamation
------------------------
- Each candidate is named and presented to the members present at the meeting.
- For each candidate, the meeting chair asks for a show of hands for those in favour and those against
  the election of the given candidate.
- The meeting chair may declare the candidate elected or not or may order a ballot be carried out as they see fit.
  
Election via Ballot
-------------------
- Each member present is provided with a ballot paper listing the candidates
- The meeting chair instructs the members that they may cast any number of votes
  up to the number of vacancies available.
- The meeting chair informs the members that casting more votes than the number of vacancies
  renders the ballot paper void.
- The meeting chair informs the members that casting the same number of votes as the number
  of vacancies, whilst permissible, is equivalent to casting no vote at all.
- The meeting chair informs the members that they may only cast a single vote for any
  given candidate.
- Members who make a mistake when casting their vote may exchange their ballot paper for
  a fresh but must surrender the original.
- Ballot papers are collected from members and held securely until counting commences.
- At counting, ballot papers are grouped by the combination of votes cast and the total number in
  each group recorded.
- From the number in each group, the number of votes for each candidate is then calculated
  and the candidate with the highest total is duly elected.
- For those groups which include a vote for the winning candidate, any remaining votes count for one half
  of a vote. The total for each group is recalculated and is the resulting total for each candidate and the
  candidate with the highest total is duly elected.
- The process is repeated until all vacancies are filled with each subsequent round reducing the 
  remaining vote value to one-third, one-quarter etc.
