We have reviewed the foreseeable risks to the UKPA and consider those
to be that PyCon UK fails to make a surplus in a given year.

The trustees decision is to hold 12 months operating cost, 50% of the financial
assistance cost and sufficient funds to wind up the operation of UKPATL. This is
estimated to be Â£20k.
