Reserves Policy
===============

The UKPA is required to detail its reserve policy as part of the annual report (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-a-charity-trustees-annual-report).

https://www.gov.uk/guidance/charity-financial-reserves provides information on the mechanics,
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-and-reserves-cc19/charities-and-reserves provides guidance on writing a policy.

Policy
------

Our original policy was described as:

    The UKPA has undertaken a review of its potential liabilities in the face of foreseeable risks and determined that a reasonable sum to hold in reserve is that required to cover the deposits for the annual conference: £37.5K

This aligned with our initial thinking, that the UKPA would be the entity directly operating PyCon UK.

In light of our decision to create the UKPA Trading Ltd. as a `subsidiary trading company <https://www.gov.uk/guidance/charities-and-trading#subsidiary-trading>`_
to operate PyCon UK,
there is a reduced need for reserves.

Our current policy is to hold a sum in reserve to cover a year's operational expenditure plus some contingency for unforeseen costs: £10k.
