Decision Making Policy
======================

All decision making processes described below are written to ensure
transparency.

Decisions
---------

When a decision is made this is to denoted in an :code:`rst` file in the
:code:`ukpa-internaldocs/source/decision/` subdirectory.

Examples of these include:

- :doc:`../decisions/2020-02-15-add-policy-on-minors`
- :doc:`../decisions/2022-11-19-treasurer-and-chair`

Decisions can lead to a policy of the UKPA.

Agreement of decisions
**********************

For a decision to be agreed the following has to occur:

1. A pull request on the `ukpa internaldocs github repository
   <https://github.com/UKPythonAssociation/ukpa-internaldocs>`_ must be opened
   with the modifications recorded in a :code:`source/decisions/<file.rst>`.
2. This pull request should be labeled with either :code:`Trustee Meeting
   Decision` or :code:`Resolution Decision` as appropriate.
3. All trustees involved with the decision (as per the constitution) need to
   approve the pull request (using Github's functionality to do so).
4. The pull request must be merged.

Policies
--------

A policy of the UKPA is recorded in an :code:`rst` file in the
:code:`ukpa-internaldocs/source/policies/` subdirectory.

Examples of these include:

- :doc:`../policies/expenses-policy`
- :doc:`../policies/john-pinner-award-policy`

Meeting records
---------------

All meetings of the UKPA are recorded in an :code:`rst` file in the
:code:`ukpa-internaldocs/source/meetings/` subdirectory:

- General meetings are recorded in
  :code:`ukpa-internaldocs/source/meeting/general/`
- Trustee meetings are recorded in
  :code:`ukpa-internaldocs/source/meeting/general/`

Records of meetings should include:

- List of those present;
- Apologies for absences;
- References to all decisions made.
