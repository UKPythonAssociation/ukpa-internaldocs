Accounts
========

We are required to prepare annual accounts.

Per the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/prepare-charitys-annual-accounts,
as we are not a company and make under Â£25,000 per year, we may choose between preparing Receipts and Payments accounts, or Accrual accounts
(https://www.gov.uk/prepare-charitys-annual-accounts/y/no/up-to-25-000).

We currently prepare Receipts and Payments accounts for simplicity.
