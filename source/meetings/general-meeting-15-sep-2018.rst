General Meeting 17:00 15-Sep-2018
=================================
Held at City Hall, Cardiff during PyCon UK 2018

Trustees Present
----------------
Owen Campbell, Kristian Glass, Peter Inglesby, Kirk Northrop, Chloe Parkes, Daniele Procida

Report
------
Owen Campbell presented a brief report the state of the UK Python Association:

* Finance - The UKPA has no bank account, no assets and no liabilities. It has received no income and incurred no expenditure.
* After seeking legal advice, the trustees have decided to form a new subsidiary trading company for the operation of PyCon UK. The reserves from previous PyCon UK conferences are still held by PyCon UK Society Ltd.

Proposal - Change UKPA Charitable Objects
-----------------------------------------
The charitable objects of the UKPA were defined by taking the objects of the original PyCon UK Society and making the minimal necessary change to satisfy the Charity Commission:

   To advance education for the public benefit in the use and understanding of the Python programming language within the UK by organising, presenting and promoting Python related conferences, meetings and events at venues in the UK.

Two situations have arisen whereby the restrictions of this object have proven problematic:

* A member had been invited to speak at an overseas PyCon event and enquired whether UKPA funding might be available
* A member wished to support an overseas PyCon event and enquired whether a donation to the UKPA could be used to do so.

The trustees considered both enquiries to be worthy of UKPA support but they fell outwith activities permitted by the current object. The trustees therefore proposed to change the charitable objects of the UKPA (subject to agreement with the Charity Commission) to:

   To advance education for the public benefit in the use and understanding of the Python programming language within the UK
   
The proposal was accepted by a show of hands


Proposal - Replace Gender Specific Language
-------------------------------------------
The UKPA constitution was created from a combination of a template document from the Charity Commission and the original constitution of the PyCon UK Society. As such, it contains several example of gender specific language (e.g. he/she, his/her) which the trustee felt were inappropriate for the UK Python community. The trustees therefore proposed to replace all such instances with appropriate gender neutral terms (e.g. they, their).

The proposal was accepted by a show of hands.

Proposal - Correct Errors in Constitution
-----------------------------------------
There are some cross-reference errors in the UKPA constitution and the trustees proposed to correct those.

The proposal was accepted by a show of hands.

Trustees
--------
Kristian Glass and Peter Inglesby, as the longest serving elected trustees, retired according to clauses 13.1.1 and 13.1.2 of the constitution.

Since Nick Tollervey had resigned as a trustee since the previous general meeting, there were thus three vacancies.

Three nominations for election as a trustee had been received from:

* Tania Allard
* Cecilia Liao
* Kristian Glass

All three were elected by a show of hands.
