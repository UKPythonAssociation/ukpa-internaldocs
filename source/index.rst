Welcome to the UKPA's Internal Documentation
============================================

Internal documentation, policies, and decisions, of `the UK Python Association <https://uk.python.org/>`_.

This is information we want public for reasons of transparency and convenience,
but probably isn't of broad general interest.
Anything we'd like to publicise or announce belongs on our main website.
