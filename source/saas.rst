Software as a Service
=====================

The UKPA uses a range of software as a service (SaaS):

* `G Suite for Nonprofits <https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/apps-for-nonprofits/>`_
	* We use this for Gmail (for uk.python.org), Calendar, Drive, Docs, Forms and more
* `Slack <https://slack.com/>`_
    * We use this for the "PyCon UK Organisers" Slack org, including the Trustees channel
* `GitHub <https://github.com>`_
    * We have two GitHub accounts
    * https://github.com/pyconuk is a `GitHub nonprofit account <https://github.com/nonprofit>`_ with unlimited private repositories, used for PyCon UK organisation and with a variety of admins
    * https://github.com/ukpythonassociation is a regular GitHub account used solely for UKPA-specific purposes like storing policies, the constitution, meeting minutes and the like
* `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
    * https://readthedocs.org/projects/ukpa-internaldocs/ - this site!
