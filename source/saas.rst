Software as a Service
=====================

The UKPA uses a range of software as a service (SaaS):

* `G Suite for Nonprofits <https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/apps-for-nonprofits/>`_

	* We use this for Gmail (for uk.python.org), Calendar, Drive, Docs, Forms and more
* `Slack <https://slack.com/>`_

    * We use this for the "PyCon UK Organisers" Slack org, including the Trustees channel
* `GitHub <https://github.com>`_

    * We have two GitHub accounts
    * https://github.com/pyconuk is a `GitHub nonprofit account <https://github.com/nonprofit>`_ with unlimited private repositories, used for PyCon UK organisation and with a variety of admins
    * https://github.com/ukpythonassociation is a regular GitHub account used solely for UKPA-specific purposes like storing policies, the constitution, meeting minutes and the like
* `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_

    * https://readthedocs.org/projects/ukpa-internaldocs/ - this site!
* `Netlify <https://www.netlify.com/>`_

    * Hosting for https://uk.python.org/
* `Discord <https://discord.com/>`_
* `Anvil <https://anvil.works/>`_
* `Donation Manager <https://www.donationmanager.co.uk/>`_
* `DNSimple <https://dnsimple.com/>`_

    * We use this for registration and DNS for ``pyconuk.org``
* `redirect.pizza <https://redirect.pizza/>`_

    * We use this for redirecting from ``pyconuk.org`` to ``$year.pyconuk.org`` (DNSimple offers a redirect service, but does not support HTTPS redirects at our current account tier)
