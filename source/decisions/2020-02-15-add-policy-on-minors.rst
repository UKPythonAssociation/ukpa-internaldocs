Policy on minors
================

This decision was taken at :doc:`../meetings/trustees/2020-02-15` according to
section 17.1 of the UKPA Constitution.


Decision
--------

The trustees have decided that a policy is needed regarding the attendance of
minors at UKPA events which will resemble the following:

    Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by an identifiable adult. This adult has
    responsibility for the minor at all times. This adult must be in attendance
    at the event whenever the minor is and must be contactable by the event
    organisers at all times.

The next step is to seek the guidance of a competent body.
