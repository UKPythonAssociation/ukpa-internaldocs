2023-03-04 Support of DjangoCon Africa 2023
===============================================

Background
----------

DjangoCon Africa takes place on 6-11 of November 2023. On 7 September 2023 the DjangoCon
Africa Chair contacted the trustees by email to request monetary support for the event.


Resolution
----------

The decision was made to support DjangoCon Africa 2023 to a value equivalent to 
their Silver level sponsorship tier ($2250 per https://2023.djangocon.africa/static/documents/djcafrica23prospectus.pdf).

The exact mechanism of doing so (donation, grant, sponsorship) is considered an 
implementation detail to be determined by UKPATL.
