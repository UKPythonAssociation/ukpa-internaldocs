2020-01-10 Response to PyCon Namibia Sponsorship Request
========================================================

This decision was taken at :doc:`../meetings/trustees/2020-01-10` according to section
17.1 of the UKPA Constitution.

Request
-------

The original request came via email. The relevant excerpts are:

    The sixth successive edition of PyCon Namibia https://na.pycon.org/ takes place
    18-20 February 2020, at the NamPower Convention Centre in Windhoek.

    This yearâ€™s sponsorship page is at https://na.pycon.org/sponsorship/. A PDF with
    the same information is attached.

    The UK Python community has had a long association with PyCon Namibia and has
    supported us since the beginning. Last year the UK Python Association sponsored
    our event, and the activities and outcomes it helped support are detailed in our
    report: https://na.pycon.org/2019/.

    As always, PyCon Namibia will publish a full conference report after the event.
    The event is covered by our well-publicised code of conduct
    https://na.pycon.org/code-of-conduct/

    The UK Python Association's support will help us cover basic costs of the
    conference: venue hire, catering and our support for attendees whose financial
    means are limited.

    We would like to request a grant from the UK Python Association once more in the
    amount of US$2000.

Discussion
----------

The trustees consider that this request is a legitimate activity for the UKPA to
support because:

- Object 2 specifically indicates supporting overseas Python events.
- This is an event organised by a member of the UKPA which is covered by object
  1.b. ("Supporting and promoting Python related projects and events organised by UKPA members")

The trustees consider that a level of US$2000 corresponds to a high proportion
of the historical level of financial assistance made to PyCon UK, sponsorship
packages and current funds. Thus, an amount equivalent to 1000 GBP is more
appropriate.

Decision
--------

The UKPA will request that the PyCon UK Society Limited (PUKSL) directors make a
payment to PyCon Namibia of 1000 GBP.
