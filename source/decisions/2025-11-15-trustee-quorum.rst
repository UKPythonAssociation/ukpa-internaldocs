2025-11-15 Quorum for Trustee Meetings
======================================

Resolution
----------

Background
--------------------
Our constitution currently defines the quorum to be two trustees but permits us to increase this if we wish. The trustees feel that increasing the quorum to three is a sensible measure given the current total number of trustees. 

Resolution
----------

Per `clause 19.3.1 of the constitution <https://github.com/UKPythonAssociation/ukpa-constitution/>`__ we have decided that the quorum for meetings of the charity trustees is 3 trustees.
