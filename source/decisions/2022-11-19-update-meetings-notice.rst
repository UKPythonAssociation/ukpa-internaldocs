Update to calling of meetings policy
====================================

Resolution
----------

The decision was made to modify :doc:`../policies/calling-of-meetings` to specify that the
notice period would now be 14 days and a second method of notification was no
longer prescribed.

The longer notice period of 30 days was deemed to not serve a practical purpose,
particularly for online meetings.

Prescribing a second method of communication was also deemed to be restrictive.
