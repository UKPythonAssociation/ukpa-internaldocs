# UKPA Internal Documentation

Internal documentation, policies, and decisions, of [the UK Python Association](https://uk.python.org/).

Published at https://ukpa-internaldocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This is a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) site - use `make dirhtml` to build.

This contains two distinct types of content, requiring two different approaches to changes:

1. Official records of charity meetings and decisions - these require appropriate PR review in line with our policies
2. Other internal bits of documentation - these can be merged with little ceremony (though we currently require one review just as a bit of a basic safety check)
